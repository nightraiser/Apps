	The white bulb indicates its off, whereas an yellow bulb states it on. Click on any bulb to turn is on/off, but the trick is here..<br>
	whenever you click on a specific bulb to perform your operation,its all adjacent bulbs are also effected, i.e if each of then is on then they get turned off, else they get turned on.<br>
	Now your game is to turn on all bulbs, try to make in most less click..
